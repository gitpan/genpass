    - code cleanup

0.05
    - "t" is still listed as easily readable, fixed POD
    - $EMPTY now Readonly
    - magic variable in grep now localized
    - rewritten main loop to allow checking of characters added
    - added "verify": making sure it contains all types user requested
    - differs between numbers, small and large caption letters - for smarter verification
    - shuffles the string: when using verification, it puts the strings in order, so shuffling is essential (from List::Util)
    - added dependencies for Readonly and List::Util in Makefile.PL
    - added check whether user wants more diversity than password length allows
