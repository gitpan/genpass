    - original version; created by ExtUtils::ModuleMaker 0.51
0.02 Wed Apr 23 11:08:00 2008
    - changed "require" to "use". Oops.
0.03 Sun Apr 27 12:15:50 2008
    - added a test script that approves everything.
    - updated POD to reflect some opinion
0.04 Wed Oct 15 11:38:18 2008
    - added "easily readable" mode, for allowing of comfortably readable passwords
    - code cleanup
    - code now easier to skim and contains more standards (though breaking some I don't care for)
0.05 (Wed Oct 15 I think)
    - "t" is still listed as easily readable, fixed POD
    - $EMPTY now Readonly
    - magic variable in grep now localized
    - rewritten main loop to allow checking of characters added
    - added "verify": making sure it contains all types user requested
    - differs between numbers, small and large caption letters - for smarter verification
    - shuffles the string: when using verification, it puts the strings in order, so shuffling is essential (from List::Util)
    - added dependencies for Readonly and List::Util in Makefile.PL
    - added check whether user wants more diversity than password length allows
0.06 Sun Oct 19 17:49:50
    - added LICENSE indication to Makefile.PL (due to a Gabor Szabo post)
    - took a jab at testing, not sure if it will develop into anything
    - rewrote the POD a bit
    - improved inline code documentation
    - changed "small caps" and "large caps" to proper "lowercase" and "uppercase"

    - allow user fingergrained selection of chars (small, large captions, numbers, etc.) through configuration
0.08 Sun Oct 26 19:59:12
    - fixed unreadable check, missing @{} for $config_opts{}

    - added "-V" and "--version" switches
0.09 Mon Oct 27 11:12:00
    - changed version printing format
    - fixed POD a bit
    - added "-s" and "--special" to force indicate special variables
