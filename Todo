TODO list for Perl distribution genpass

  - Testing suite (problematic, view t/001_load.t)
  - Read configuration file from home folder or indicated conf from command line
  - Allow user fingergrained selection of chars (small, large captions, numbers, etc.)
  - Refactor verification code (if() clauses)
  - Perhaps rewrite and refactor verification none {} with any {}
