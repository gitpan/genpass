TODO list for Perl distribution genpass

  - allow user fingergrained selection of chars (small, large captions, numbers, etc.) through command line
  - refactor verification code (if() clauses)
  - perhaps rewrite and refactor verification none {} with any {}
  - fix GetOptions parameters ('no-special' to 'special=!' etc.)
  - testing suite (problematic, view t/001_load.t)
