DESCRIPTION
    if you've ever needed to create 10 (or even 10,000) passwords on the fly
    with varying preferences (lowercase, uppercase, no confusing characters,
    special characters, minimum length, etc.), you know it can become a
    pretty pesky task.

    This script makes it possible to create flexible and secure passwords,
    quickly and easily.

BUGS
    None that I know of. Please report if and when you find any.

A Word on Moral
    Our lives depend on the decisions of others in the world, and so, other
    lives depend on our decisions. When we decide to consume animals, we
    dedicate the death of others, and it is something to consider giving up.
