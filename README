SYNOPSIS
    genpass [-c | --config FILE] [--read-config | --no-read-config] [-l |

    [--verify | --no-verify]

        -c | --config FILE     read config file from FILE (default is $HOME/.genpassrc)
             --read-config     read the configuration file (this is the default behavior)

        -e | --readable        print only easily readable characters (no "o", "O", "0", "l", "1", "I")
           | --verify          makes sure it's got every type of char (a tad slower), default behavior
           | --no-verify       doesn't make sure you get every type of char (a tad faster)

DESCRIPTION
    if you've ever needed to create 10 (or even 10,000) passwords on the fly
    with varying preferences (lowercase, uppercase, no confusing characters,
    special characters, minimum length, etc.), you know it can become a
    pretty pesky task.

    This script makes it possible to create flexible and secure passwords,
    quickly and easily.

    Starting version 0.07 it also supports a configuration file (default is
    .genpassrc is your home folder) across multiple operating systems
    (thanks to Ken Williams and Adam Kennedy's great modules: Path::Class
    and File::HomDir, respectively).

    You can configure the following things in the configuration file:
    - lowercase_chars ( default is 'a'..'z' )
    - uppercase_chars ( deafult is 'A'..'Z' )
    - numerical_chars ( default is '0'..'9' )
    - unreadable_chars ( default is o,O,0,l,1,I )
    - special_chars ( default is !,@,#,$,%,^,&,*,(,) )
    - readable ( default is 0 )
    - special ( default is 1 )
    - verify ( default is 1 )
    - repeat ( default is 10 )
    - length ( default is 15 )

    See POD of Config::General (perldoc Config::General) for more
    information on the file format.

A Word on Moral
    Our lives depend on the decisions of others in the world, and so, other
    lives depend on our decisions. When we decide to consume animals, we
    dedicate the death of others, and it is something to consider giving up.
